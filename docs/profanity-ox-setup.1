.PP
Profanity wants to give the user a maximum freedom in setting up their
system.
So we won\[cq]t touch your GPG settings directly.
Which means you will need to do some manual steps.
They are described here
.SH Generate OpenPGP key materials
.PP
The first step is to create a OpenPGP key pair.
The key pair generation will be done with the \f[V]gpg\f[R] command of
GnuPG.

\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This command will generated a OpenPGP key with a UID
\f[V]xmpp:alice\[at]domain.tld\f[R].
The option \f[V]future-default\f[R] has been used to generate a
ed25519/cv25519 key.
The key is set to expire in threeyears.

will help you to filter the data.
